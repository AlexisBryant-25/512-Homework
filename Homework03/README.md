Instructions from Canvas:
Please submit your assignment as a Jupyter Notebook! Ideally, you should get Binder running for this assignment and have this assignment there, 
so that we can run your code in your repo. If you do not have Binder set up, please see the instructions hereLinks to an external site. - pay attention to the notes!
Important Note:
It is easier and preferred for you to create files on your local computer and then upload them to your git repo. However, if you went into Binder and then created and 
edited your Jupyter Notebook, IT WILL NOT AUTO SAVE. Please see hereLinks to an external site. for how to save files created on Binder to your git repo.
